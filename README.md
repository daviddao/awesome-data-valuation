| [Performative Prediction](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/perdomo20a.html) | Juan Perdomo, Tijana Zrnic, Celestine Mendler-Dünner, Moritz Hardt | 2020 | <details><summary>Summary</summary> Perdomo et al. (2020) introduce the concept of "performative prediction" dealing with predictions that influence the target they aim to predict, e.g. through taking actions based on the predictions, causing a distribution shift. The authors develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction and introduce the equilibrium notion of performative stability where predictions are calibrated against future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction. </details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@inproceedings{perdomo2020performative,<br>  title={Performative prediction},<br>  author={Perdomo, Juan and Zrnic, Tijana and Mendler-D{\"u}nner, Celestine and Hardt, Moritz},<br>  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},<br>  pages={7599--7609},<br>  year={2020},<br>  organization={PMLR}<br>}</pre> </details> | | |

(2020) look at stochastic optimization for performative prediction and prove convergence rates for greedily deploying models after each stochastic update (which may cause distribution shift affecting convergence to a stability point) or lazily deploying the model after several updates. </details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@article{mendler2020stochastic,<br>  title={Stochastic optimization for performative prediction},<br>  author={Mendler-D{\"u}nner, Celestine and Perdomo, Juan and Zrnic, Tijana and Hardt, Moritz},<br>  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},<br>  volume={33},<br>  pages={4929--4939},<br>  year={2020}<br>}</pre> </details> | | |

| [Strategic Classification is Causal Modeling in Disguise](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/miller20b) | John Miller, Smitha Milli, Moritz Hardt | 2020 | <details><summary>Summary</summary> Miller et al. (2020) argue that strategic classication involves causal modelling and designing incentives for improvement requires solving a non-trivial causal inference problem. The authors provide a distinction between gaming and improvement as well as provide a causal framework for strategic adaptation. </details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@inproceedings{miller2020strategic,<br>  title={Strategic classification is causal modeling in disguise},<br>  author={Miller, John and Milli, Smitha and Hardt, Moritz},<br>  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},<br>  pages={6917--6926},<br>  year={2020},<br>  organization={PMLR}<br>}</pre> </details> | | |

(2021) show that standard microfoundations in strategic classification, that typically uses individual-level behaviour to deduce aggregate-level responses, can lead to degenerate behaviour in aggregate: discontinuities in the aggregate response, stable points ceasing to exist, and maximizing social burden. The authors introduce a noisy response model inspired by performative prediction that mitigates these limitations for binary classification. </details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@inproceedings{jagadeesan2021alternative,<br>  title={Alternative microfoundations for strategic classification},<br>  author={Jagadeesan, Meena and Mendler-D{\"u}nner, Celestine and Hardt, Moritz},<br>  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},<br>  pages={4687--4697},<br>  year={2021},<br>  organization={PMLR}<br>}</pre></details> | | |
