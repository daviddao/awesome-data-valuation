(2020) introduce the concept of "performative prediction" dealing with predictions that influence the target they aim to predict, e.g. through taking actions based on the predictions, causing a distribution shift. The authors develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction and introduce the equilibrium notion of performative stability where predictions are calibrated against future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction. </details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@inproceedings{perdomo2020performative,<br>  title={Performative prediction},<br>  author={Perdomo, Juan and Zrnic, Tijana and Mendler-D{\"u}nner, Celestine and Hardt, Moritz},<br>  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},<br>  pages={7599--7609},<br>  year={2020},<br>  organization={PMLR}<br>}</pre> </details> | | |

(2021) show that standard microfoundations in strategic classification, that typically uses individual-level behaviour to deduce aggregate-level responses, can lead to degenerate behaviour in aggregate: discontinuities in the aggregate response, stable points ceasing to exist, and maximizing social burden. The authors introduce a noisy response model inspired by performative prediction that mitigates these limitations for binary classification. </details> | <details><summary>Bibtex</summary><pre>@inproceedings{jagadeesan2021alternative,<br>  title={Alternative microfoundations for strategic classification},<br>  author={Jagadeesan, Meena and Mendler-D{\"u}nner, Celestine and Hardt, Moritz},<br>  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},<br>  pages={4687--4697},<br>  year={2021},<br>  organization={PMLR}<br>}</pre></details> | | |
